      description: 'Associates the customer''s account with the payment processor to the Google instrument being added. Account association happens after the integrator has authenticated the user. Association occurs via a server-to-server call that contains the `requestId` for the associated authentication flow (`authenticationRequestId`), an `associationId` and a `googlePaymentToken` (GPT). The payment processor should associate the `associationId` and the `googlePaymentToken` to the customer''s account for authentication. The GPT is used to initiate payments. The `associationId` is used during re-authentication calls to identify the account for authentication. If Google sends an `associationId` or a `googlePaymentToken` that the integrator has already seen during a different association, then it throws an error. An example request looks like: { "requestHeader": { "protocolVersion": { "major": 2 }, "requestId": "bWVyY2hhbnQgdHJhbnNhY3Rpb24gaWQ", "requestTimestamp": { "epochMillis": "1502220196077" }, "paymentIntegratorAccountId": "InvisiCashUSD" }, "authenticationRequestId": "bnAxdWTydDX==", "googlePaymentToken": { "issuerId": { "value": "InvisiCashUSA" }, "token": "ZXhhbXBsZSB1bmlxdWUgcGF5bWVudCB0b2tlbiB2YWx1ZQ" }, "associationId": "LmddbXBsZSByZWZlcmVuY2UgdG9rZW4gdmFsdWU", "provideUserInformation": true } An example response looks like: { "responseHeader": { "responseTimestamp": { "epochMillis": "1481900013178" } }, "result": { "success": { "bankAccountIdentifier": { "singaporeBankAccount": { "sgFastBankAccount": { "localAccountNumber": "113A", "swiftBic": { "value": "COBADEFF478" } }, "localBankIdentifier":{ "localBankCode": "7171", "localBranchCode": "060" } } }, "bankAccountDetails" : { "accountNumberSuffix": "1234", "bankAccountType": { "type": "SAVINGS" }, "bankAccountMetadata": { } }, "transactionLimits": { "transactionMaxLimit": { "noLimit": {} } }, "userInformation": { "name": "Example Customer", "addressLine": ["70 Pasir Panjang Rd"], "localityName": "#03-71", "postalCodeNumber": "117371", "countryCode": "SG" } } } } '

The evaluation criteria can be presented in the form of a set of challenges, such as: 1) Acknowledgement of the resolved identity of the payee proxy; Note: we will omit this for the first iteration; we assume that payee proxy lookup has already been performed in a previous GetPayeeProxyDisplayInfo call. 2) Agreement to quoted transfer parameters, including calculated transfer fees, 3) Re-authentication or 2FA, e.g. OTP.
